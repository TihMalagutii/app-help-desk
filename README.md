This project is a web application for customer support, where users can open tickets to report issues or ask questions about a specific product or service. Users can provide information about the subject of the ticket and a detailed description of the problem or inquiry.

The application includes two types of users: administrators and non-administrators. Administrators have full access to the system and can view all open tickets, regardless of the user who created them.

On the other hand, non-administrators have limited access and can only view the tickets they have opened themselves. This is done to protect the privacy of user information and ensure that each user only sees the tickets relevant to them.
